Messy but usefull....

Set of tools written in Python for procesing geophysical data.</br>
Developped through time with field work experience and specific needs mostly for georesistivity but can be used for magnetometry.</br>

Features:
- Download RM85 Geoscan data (no Geoplot needed)
- Rotate/flip/assemble grids
- Despike
- Edge matching
- Low/high pass filter
- Local variance
- Make hillshade
- Export as geotiff
- Georeferencing with Ground Control Points
- Export preview as png

- ... embryon of a graphic interface (GUI)

Future developments:
- Better integration of workflow (not in command line / python script)
- Integrate the set of tools as QGIS plugin / ArcGIS Toolbox
- GUI
- Tomography processing
- ???
